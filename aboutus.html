<h1>About Us</h1>

<h3>Our purpose</h3>
<p>Conceptualized by leading South Indian actress - Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Pratyusha Support has started its services in February 2014. Since then, we have been serving the underprivileged by delivering some unparalleled medical support to women and children, while fulfilling wishes of those children suffering from life-threatening medical conditions. We have been closely working with our partnered hospitals, Rainbow, Continental, Livlife, Ankura and Andhra Hospitals in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states primarily. Apart from this, our associations with WAP Foundation and Meenakshi Mission Hospital based at Bangalore, Karnataka and Chennai, Tamil Nadu, respectively, have helped us partner in organizing some free medical camps, including an eye surgery camp for 50 underprivileged elderly people. Organizing free medical check-up campaigns, free child vaccination campaigns, blood donation camps, awareness programmes and helping families financially overcome severe situations and medical crisis have been our primary services.</p>

<h3>Sponsor A Child</h3>
<p>Pratyusha Support is now officially associated with an orphanage named Pyaram Vijaya Bharathi Vidya Sagar Charitable trust located in Nadargul village, Ranga Reddy District of Telangana. Founded in the year 2008, hosting just 2 kids with 5 rooms initially, by Mr. Vidya Sagar along with some of his good and like-minded friends and socialists, today shelters about 28 children, both boys and girls. Right from providing food, clothing, shelter, education and all primary necessities for its children, the orphanage is now looking at accommodating more needy children with the help of Pratyusha Support.

Seshanka Binesh, Manager- Pratyusha Support and one of the trustees of the orphanage along with the other trustees, have been striving hard since years, to give shape to the future of these 28 beautiful souls. You could now join hands with Pratyusha Support and become a part of this wonderful journey, a cause which offers shelter to the orphans, by sponsoring atleast Rs.1200 per month, which could suffice expenses fulfilling the primary necessities like food, clothing, education and shelter, of a child for a month. Your generous contribution could serve as a source of living to many more of such unfortunate children.</p>

<h3>About the Founder</h3>
<p>Samantha Ruth Prabhu, a popular film personality and a social worker is the founder of this organization. Pratyusha Support is her attempt to do something for the society which gave her unexpected love and joy at times she needed the most.</p>

<h4>Samantha's story</h4>
<p>"Happiness is giving than receiving. Pratyusha means new dawn, it's a thought of self realization that I had when I was dull and down with a severe illness. When you are an actor and a star, you receive so much love from everyone. It automatically becomes our duty to do something in return for the people who made us such big personalities. God has been kind to me and I consider it as his blessing that he chose me to do something for Him and the people. Through Pratyusha Support, I genuinely want to make a small difference in this unjust society."</p>
